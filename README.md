Portfolio Website

This is a modern, full-stack portfolio website designed to showcase personal projects, technical skills, and professional experience. The site is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and it emphasizes clean design, responsive layouts, and smooth animations to create an engaging user experience.
